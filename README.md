# TestGutter

Shows test-by-test statuses in the gutter of your editor. Inspired by Xcode.

## Integrations

This plugin doesn't do anything on its own. You should instead use these implementations in
conjunction with this plugin:

* RSpec: [test-gutter-rspec](https://github.com/stevenpetryk/test-gutter-rspec)

## Installation

```bash
apm install test-gutter
```

## Help wanted

I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to Atom plugins, so feel free to contribute. I just
wanted to make a sexier test runner than what was currently out there.
